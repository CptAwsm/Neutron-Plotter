# Neutron Plotter Plugin for EDMC

This plugin for **ED Market Connector (EDMC)** helps Elite Dangerous players follow a neutron star route from a CSV file, such as those generated by tools like **[Spansh Neutron Plotter](https://www.spansh.co.uk/)**. 

The plugin copies the next system in the route to your clipboard after detecting that you've entered a system from the route. It also displays the copied system name in a temporary overlay on the screen.

---

## Features

- **Route Loading**: Load a CSV file containing a neutron star route.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically copies the next system in the route to the clipboard as you travel.
- **Overlay Display**: Shows a small overlay with the system name copied to the clipboard for easy reference.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly with EDMCâ€™s journal entry processing to keep track of your progress through the route.

---

## Requirements

- **EDMC (ED Market Connector)**: Version 5.12.1+.
- **Python 3.11+**: EDMC ships with Python embedded, but ensure compatibility with your system.
- **Spansh Neutron Plotter CSV**: Generate a neutron star route using [Spansh Neutron Plotter](https://www.spansh.co.uk/) and download it as a CSV file.

---

## Installation

1. **Download the Plugin**:
   - Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
   - Ensure the `neutron_plotter` or `neutron-plotter-main` folder is placed in the EDMC `plugins` directory:
     ```
     <EDMC Installation Directory>/plugins/neutron_plotter/
     ```

2. **Generate a Route from Spansh**:
   - Go to [Spansh Neutron Plotter](https://www.spansh.co.uk/).
   - Input your starting location and destination, and generate a route.
   - Download the route as a CSV file.

3. **Restart EDMC**:
   - Restart EDMC to load the plugin.
   - You should see a **"Neutron Plotter"** tab in the settings.

---

## Usage

1. **Load the Route**:
   - Open the EDMC settings and navigate to the **"Neutron Plotter"** tab.
   - Click **"Select Route CSV"** to choose your downloaded CSV file.

2. **Start Flying**:
   - Jump to the first system in the route. The plugin will detect your location from the Elite Dangerous journal.

3. **Clipboard and Overlay**:
   - When you enter a system listed in the route, the next system in the route will be copied to the clipboard automatically.
   - An overlay will briefly display the name of the system copied.

---

## CSV Format

Ensure the CSV file contains the following columns (case-insensitive):

- **System Name**: Name of the star system.
- **Neutron Star**: Indicates whether the system has a neutron star (e.g., "Yes" or "No").

Example CSV:
```csv
"System Name","Distance To Arrival","Distance Remaining","Neutron Star","Jumps"
"Juenae LV-Y c3-931","0","25944.7461619347","No","0"
"Hypio Pri IZ-D d13-6549","417.790763505265","25649.5506279548","Yes","7"
"Hypio Pri QF-L d9-1705","288.125796501068","25362.3994442237","Yes","1"
```

# Troubleshooting
## Clipboard Not Working:

Ensure no other program is interfering with clipboard operations.

Try restarting EDMC.

## Overlay Not Displaying:

Make sure your system allows tkinter to create new windows.

Check the EDMC logs for error messages.

## Route Not Loading:

Confirm the CSV file follows the format described above.

Ensure the CSV file is accessible and not open in another application.
